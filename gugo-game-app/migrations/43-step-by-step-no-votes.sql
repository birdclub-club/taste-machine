-- ðŸ“‰ Step-by-Step Retroactive NO Vote Counting
-- Run each query separately to avoid timeouts

-- ===== STEP 1: ANALYSIS (Run this first) =====
-- Check if you have NO votes to process

-- Create a table to track which NFTs need vote count updates
CREATE TEMP TABLE IF NOT EXISTS no_vote_updates (

-- Update NFT vote counts based on tracking table
