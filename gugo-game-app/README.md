## 📊 Dynamic Token Economics

The game uses **live market pricing** with hourly updates for responsive economics:

- **Minimum Purchase**: 10 votes = $0.40 USD
- **Payment Methods**: ETH or GUGO tokens  
- **Price Updates**: Fetched hourly from live market data
- **Eligibility**: Need $0.40 worth of **either** ETH OR GUGO (not both)

### Pricing Philosophy:
- **Responsive Pricing**: Uses live market prices updated hourly
- **Consistent Economics**: Same pricing for testnet (FGUGO) and mainnet (GUGO)
- **Fair Market Access**: Reflects real-time market conditions
- **Cache**: 1-hour price caching for performance

### Price Sources:
- **ETH**: Live market price from CryptoCompare API
- **GUGO**: Live market price from multiple sources (CryptoCompare, CoinGecko, DEX)
- **Manual Updates**: Use `scripts/update-gugo-price.js` to set GUGO prices when needed

### Updating GUGO Price:
```bash
# Update GUGO price manually (example with $0.25)
node scripts/update-gugo-price.js 0.25
```
