# üßπ FIRE Vote Data Cleanup Guide

**Maintaining Leaderboard Integrity & Authentic Curation**

*A comprehensive guide for identifying and cleaning test data pollution in the FIRE voting system*

---

## üìä **Problem Solved**

### **üö® Before Cleanup (Test Data Pollution)**
- **RUYUI Collection**: 6 NFTs dominating top 10 (60% of leaderboard)
- **Suspicious Pattern**: Uniform FIRE votes across collection
- **User Impact**: Inauthentic leaderboard hiding genuinely appreciated NFTs
- **Root Cause**: Test wallet (`0x0134ed2fA6832e6dE142B4F986679D340E308CF4`) created artificial FIRE votes during feature development

### **‚úÖ After Cleanup (Authentic Curation)**
- **BEEISH Collection**: 4 NFTs in top 9 (genuine aesthetic appeal)
- **Collection Diversity**: 5 different collections represented
- **Authentic Pattern**: Natural distribution of FIRE votes
- **User Impact**: Real aesthetic preferences driving leaderboard rankings

---

## üîç **Detection Process**

### **Step 1: Identify Suspicious Patterns**
```sql
-- Check collection dominance patterns
SELECT 
  collection_name,
  COUNT(*) as nfts_in_top_20,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 20, 1) as percentage_dominance
FROM (
  SELECT collection_name
  FROM public.get_fire_first_leaderboard_v2(20)
) leaderboard
GROUP BY collection_name
ORDER BY nfts_in_top_20 DESC;
```

**üö® Red Flags:**
- Single collection >40% of top 20
- Uniform FIRE vote counts across collection
- Multiple NFTs from same collection with identical scores

### **Step 2: Investigate FIRE Vote Sources**
```sql
-- Analyze FIRE vote patterns by wallet
SELECT 
  f.wallet_address,
  f.collection_name,
  COUNT(*) as fire_votes_created,
  array_agg(n.name ORDER BY n.name) as nft_names,
  MIN(f.created_at) as first_vote,
  MAX(f.created_at) as last_vote
FROM public.favorites f
JOIN public.nfts n ON f.nft_id = n.id::text
WHERE f.vote_type = 'fire'
GROUP BY f.wallet_address, f.collection_name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3  -- Focus on wallets with multiple FIRE votes
ORDER BY fire_votes_created DESC;
```

**üö® Suspicious Indicators:**
- High vote count from single wallet
- Concentrated voting within short timeframe
- Known test/development wallet addresses

### **Step 3: Cross-Reference with Development Activity**
- Check wallet addresses against known test accounts
- Review development logs for feature testing periods
- Validate against legitimate user engagement patterns

## üîß **Cleanup Implementation**

### **Step 1: Pre-Cleanup Analysis**
```sql
-- Document current state before cleanup
SELECT 
  'BEFORE_CLEANUP' as status,
  collection_name,
  COUNT(*) as nfts_in_leaderboard
FROM (
  SELECT collection_name
  FROM public.get_fire_first_leaderboard_v2(20)
) current_leaderboard
GROUP BY collection_name
ORDER BY nfts_in_leaderboard DESC;
```

### **Step 2: Identify Specific Test Data**
```sql
-- Target specific test wallet votes for removal
SELECT 
  f.wallet_address,
  f.collection_name,
  COUNT(*) as votes_to_remove,
  array_agg(n.name ORDER BY n.name) as affected_nfts
FROM public.favorites f
JOIN public.nfts n ON f.nft_id = n.id::text
WHERE f.vote_type = 'fire'
  AND f.wallet_address = '0x0134ed2fA6832e6dE142B4F986679D340E308CF4'  -- Known test wallet
GROUP BY f.wallet_address, f.collection_name;
```

### **Step 3: Execute Cleanup**
```sql
-- Remove test FIRE votes (EXECUTE CAREFULLY)
DELETE FROM public.favorites 
WHERE vote_type = 'fire'
  AND wallet_address = '0x0134ed2fA6832e6dE142B4F986679D340E308CF4';

-- Verify deletion count
SELECT ROW_COUNT() as votes_removed;
```

### **Step 4: Post-Cleanup Verification**
```sql
-- Verify improved leaderboard diversity
SELECT 
  'AFTER_CLEANUP' as status,
  collection_name,
  COUNT(*) as nfts_in_leaderboard
FROM (
  SELECT collection_name
  FROM public.get_fire_first_leaderboard_v2(20)
) cleaned_leaderboard
GROUP BY collection_name
ORDER BY nfts_in_leaderboard DESC;
```

## üìã **Cleanup Checklist**

### **üîç Pre-Cleanup Validation**
- [ ] **Identify suspicious patterns** in leaderboard distribution
- [ ] **Document test wallet addresses** used during development
- [ ] **Backup current state** for rollback capability
- [ ] **Validate targeting** - ensure only test data will be removed

### **üßπ Cleanup Execution**
- [ ] **Run detection queries** to identify specific records
- [ ] **Execute removal commands** with precise targeting
- [ ] **Verify deletion counts** match expectations
- [ ] **Test leaderboard function** immediately after cleanup

### **‚úÖ Post-Cleanup Verification**
- [ ] **Check collection diversity** in new leaderboard
- [ ] **Validate FIRE vote authenticity** of remaining data
- [ ] **Test frontend leaderboard** displays correctly
- [ ] **Document improvements** for future reference

## üéØ **Success Metrics**

### **Collection Diversity Improvement**
```sql
-- Measure diversity improvement
WITH leaderboard_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    collection_name,
    COUNT(*) as nft_count,
    COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 20 as percentage
  FROM (
    SELECT collection_name
    FROM public.get_fire_first_leaderboard_v2(20)
  ) lb
  GROUP BY collection_name
)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_collections_represented,
  MAX(percentage) as max_collection_dominance,
  AVG(percentage) as avg_collection_representation
FROM leaderboard_stats;
```

**üéØ Target Metrics:**
- **Collection Count**: 4+ different collections in top 20
- **Max Dominance**: <50% for any single collection
- **Distribution**: More natural spread across collections

### **FIRE Vote Authenticity**
```sql
-- Measure authentic FIRE vote patterns
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT f.wallet_address) as unique_fire_voters,
  COUNT(*) as total_fire_votes,
  AVG(vote_count) as avg_votes_per_wallet
FROM (
  SELECT 
    wallet_address,
    COUNT(*) as vote_count
  FROM public.favorites 
  WHERE vote_type = 'fire'
  GROUP BY wallet_address
) wallet_stats;
```

**üéØ Target Metrics:**
- **Unique Voters**: Diverse wallet participation
- **Vote Distribution**: Organic spread, not concentrated
- **Average per Wallet**: 1-3 FIRE votes per user (natural behavior)

---

## üö® **Prevention Strategies**

### **1. Test Data Segregation**
- **Dedicated Test Environment**: Separate test database for feature development
- **Test Wallet Registry**: Document all development wallet addresses
- **Environment Flags**: Clear marking of test vs. production data

### **2. Data Validation Monitoring**
```sql
-- Create monitoring view for suspicious patterns
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW suspicious_fire_patterns AS
SELECT 
  f.wallet_address,
  f.collection_name,
  COUNT(*) as fire_votes,
  array_agg(n.name) as nft_names,
  'HIGH_VOLUME_SINGLE_COLLECTION' as alert_type
FROM public.favorites f
JOIN public.nfts n ON f.nft_id = n.id::text
WHERE f.vote_type = 'fire'
GROUP BY f.wallet_address, f.collection_name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5  -- Alert threshold
ORDER BY fire_votes DESC;
```

### **3. Automated Detection**
- **Daily Monitoring**: Check for unusual FIRE vote patterns
- **Collection Dominance Alerts**: Flag when single collection >40% of leaderboard
- **Wallet Pattern Detection**: Identify concentrated voting behavior

### **4. Development Best Practices**
- **Test Data Cleanup**: Always clean test data before production deployment
- **Documentation Requirements**: Log all test wallet addresses used
- **Feature Testing Protocol**: Use isolated test environments
- **Production Validation**: Verify data integrity before feature release

## üìö **Case Study: RUYUI Collection Cleanup**

### **Problem Identification**
- **Date**: Discovered during leaderboard review
- **Issue**: RUYUI collection had 6/20 NFTs in top leaderboard (30% dominance)
- **Cause**: Test wallet `0x0134ed2fA6832e6dE142B4F986679D340E308CF4` created artificial FIRE votes

### **Investigation Results**
```
Test Wallet Activity:
- Wallet: 0x0134ed2fA6832e6dE142B4F986679D340E308CF4
- FIRE Votes Created: 20 votes across RUYUI collection
- Time Period: Feature testing phase
- Impact: Artificial leaderboard dominance
```

### **Cleanup Execution**
- **Method**: Targeted deletion of votes from specific test wallet
- **Records Removed**: 20 FIRE votes
- **Collections Affected**: RUYUI (removed from top 20)
- **Execution Time**: <5 seconds

### **Results Achieved**
```
Before Cleanup:
- RUYUI: 6 NFTs (30% dominance)
- Collection Diversity: 3 collections

After Cleanup:
- RUYUI: 0 NFTs (eliminated)
- Collection Diversity: 5 collections
- BEEISH: 4 NFTs (genuine aesthetic appeal)
- Authentic curation restored
```

### **Lessons Learned**
1. **Test Data Impact**: Even small amounts of test data can significantly skew results
2. **Detection Importance**: Regular monitoring catches issues before they affect users
3. **Cleanup Effectiveness**: Targeted removal restores authentic patterns
4. **User Experience**: Authentic leaderboard provides better aesthetic curation
