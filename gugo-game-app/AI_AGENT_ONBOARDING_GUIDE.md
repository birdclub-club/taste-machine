# ü§ñ AI Agent Onboarding Guide - Taste Machine Project

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Complete context and guidelines for AI agents working on the Taste Machine NFT voting platform

## üéØ Project Overview

**Taste Machine** is a sophisticated NFT aesthetic voting platform where users vote on NFT matchups to earn rewards. The platform features dynamic theming, responsive design, and a complex reward system with prize breaks every 10 votes.

### Core Concept
- Users vote between two NFTs in head-to-head matchups
- Votes are called "Licks" - users can purchase more or get free daily votes
- Every 10 votes triggers a "Prize Break" with XP, GUGO tokens, or other rewards
- Platform uses dynamic color palettes that change on each landing page visit
- Swiss-inspired minimalist design with "PROOF OF AESTHETIC‚Ñ¢" branding

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design System

### Container Architecture (CRITICAL)
The layout uses a **unified container system**:

```
Status Bar (compact, 45px height)
‚Üì
Colossal Text Container (full viewport below status bar)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "PROOF OF" (top-left corner)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "AES THETIC‚Ñ¢" (bottom-right corner)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Matchup Interface (centered)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Bottom Info Text (centered at bottom)
```

### Responsive Design Rules
- **NFT Cards**: Scale with viewport using `clamp(300px, 25vw, 500px)`
- **Spacing**: Dynamic using `clamp(var(--space-4), 4vw, var(--space-8))`
- **Mobile Breakpoint**: 900px (not 768px)
- **Desktop-first approach** for matchup interface, mobile gets slider

### Color System (ESSENTIAL)
- **Dynamic CSS Variables**: `--dynamic-bg-color`, `--dynamic-text-color`, `--dynamic-accent-color`
- **15 Color Palettes**: Randomly selected on landing page, propagated globally
- **NO hardcoded colors** - everything must use CSS variables
- **Theme consistency** across all components

## üé® Typography & Branding

### Font Hierarchy
- **Primary**: Neue Haas Unica (Adobe Typekit) - titles, landing page
- **Secondary**: King's Caslon Regular - body text
- **Colossal Text**: "PROOF OF" (top-left), "AES THETIC‚Ñ¢" (bottom-right)
- **Status Bar**: "TASTE MACHINE" branding

### Swiss Design Principles
- Minimalist aesthetic inspired by 60s-70s Swiss graphic design
- Clean typography with precise positioning
- Functional, uncluttered layouts
- Emphasis on negative space and proportion

## üîß Technical Implementation Rules

### Performance Optimization (CRITICAL)
The platform uses an **Enhanced System** for optimal performance:

1. **Preloading Strategy**
   - Always preload next 3-5 matchups in background
   - Use IPFS gateway rotation for failed images
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

2. **Database Optimization**
   - Enhanced system reduces database calls by 80%
   - Batch operations where possible
   - Use connection pooling and query optimization

3. **Image Loading**
   - Multiple IPFS gateways with health checking
   - Fallback mechanisms for failed loads
   - Lazy loading for non-critical images

### State Management
- **Voting Sessions**: Managed via `useSessionKey` hook
- **Prize Breaks**: Triggered every 10 votes, managed by `usePrizeBreak`
- **User State**: Centralized in StatusBar with refresh capabilities
- **Matchup State**: Preloaded and cached for smooth transitions

## üéÆ User Experience Flow

### Voting Interface
1. **Desktop**: Click-to-vote (no slider)
2. **Mobile**: Retains slider functionality for better touch experience
3. **Super Votes**: Fire button (üî•) for exceptional NFTs
4. **NO Button**: Appears after 3 seconds if user doesn't vote

### Prize Break System
- **Frequency**: Every 10 votes
- **Types**: XP, GUGO tokens, votes, visual effects
- **Modal**: Card flip animation with dynamic content
- **Treasury-scaled odds**: Higher treasury = better rewards

### Matchup Selection Logic
- **Cross-collection** and **same-collection** voting
- **User preferences** for collection filtering
- **Balanced rotation** to ensure variety
- **Preloading** for seamless experience

## üìã Essential Documents to Read

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Rules & Guidelines

### DO NOT Break These Rules

1. **Container Structure**: Never modify the colossal text container architecture without understanding the full layout system

2. **CSS Variables**: Always use `--dynamic-*` variables, never hardcode colors

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test all changes at 900px breakpoint and below

4. **Performance**: Maintain the enhanced system - any changes must not increase database load

5. **Typography**: Preserve Swiss design principles and font hierarchy

6. **Image Loading**: Always implement proper error handling and fallbacks

### Memory Preferences (IMPORTANT)
- **User prefers Cursor's GitHub integration** over manual git commands
- **Don't commit after every change** - only for critical fixes
- **Keep development server running** - don't stop it when making changes
- **NO votes count as aesthetic feedback** - they're valuable data
- **Debug borders are temporary** - remove before production

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. **Read relevant documentation** from the list above
