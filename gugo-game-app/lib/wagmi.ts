/*
 * ðŸ”§ Note about browser wallet conflicts:
 * 
 * If you have both MetaMask and Phantom extensions installed, you may see
 * a secondary popup asking "Which extension do you want to connect with?"
 * 
 * This is NOT from RainbowKit - it's a browser-level conflict where both
 * wallet extensions try to inject into window.ethereum.
 * 
 * The app now gracefully handles users declining this popup without errors.
 * This behavior is expected and won't break the app.
