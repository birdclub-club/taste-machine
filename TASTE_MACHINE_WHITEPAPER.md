## Executive Summary

**Taste Machine** introduces the world's first aesthetic-driven NFT gaming protocol, built on Abstract Chain. Our core philosophyâ€”"Beauty Over Metadata"â€”challenges the industry's obsession with rarity-based valuations by creating a decentralized system where visual appeal determines worth.

Through sophisticated Elo-based ranking algorithms, deflationary tokenomics, and gamified voting mechanics, Taste Machine transforms subjective aesthetic preferences into objective, market-driven signals. Users vote on NFT aesthetics to earn GUGO tokens, XP, and governance power while contributing to a new paradigm of value discovery.

**Key Metrics:**
- **46,615+ NFTs** across 8+ collections at launch
- **Deflationary Economics**: 50% of all rewards burned
- **Multi-Chain Ready**: Starting on Abstract Testnet, expanding to mainnet
- **Gaming-First**: Session keys, streak bonuses, and prize break mechanics

**ðŸš€ Current Status (August 2025):**
- **âœ… Live & Operational**: Deployed on Vercel with full functionality
- **âœ… Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with 46,615+ NFTs active
- **âœ… Purchase Flow**: Robust Licks purchasing with retry mechanisms
- **âœ… Voting System**: Matchup and slider voting fully operational
- **âœ… Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback

## Problem Statement

### The Metadata Trap

The current NFT ecosystem is fundamentally broken. Value determination relies heavily on:

1. **Artificial Scarcity**: Rarity scores based on metadata combinations
2. **Trait Gaming**: Projects manipulating trait distributions for perceived value
3. **Speculation Over Aesthetics**: Beautiful art undervalued due to "common" traits
4. **Lack of Consensus**: No decentralized mechanism to determine aesthetic value

### Market Inefficiencies

- **Undervalued Aesthetics**: Visually stunning NFTs trade below inferior pieces due to metadata
- **Creator Misalignment**: Artists optimize for trait rarity over artistic vision
- **User Frustration**: Collectors struggle to discover aesthetically valuable pieces
- **Market Manipulation**: Trait-based valuations easily gamed by informed actors

### The Aesthetic Gap

Current NFT platforms provide no mechanism for the community to collectively determine aesthetic value, leaving individual preference as the only signalâ€”creating massive inefficiencies in price discovery.

**Total Supply**: Dynamic (deflationary)
**Initial Distribution**:
- **40%** Community Rewards Pool
- **25%** Development & Operations
- **20%** Marketing & Partnerships
- **10%** Team (4-year vesting)
- **5%** Initial Liquidity

### Token Utilities

1. **Voting Power**: 1 GUGO = 1 vote (convertible to Licks)
2. **Super Votes**: 5 GUGO for 2x Elo impact
3. **Prize Break Entry**: Staking requirements for higher reward tiers
4. **Governance**: Protocol parameter voting
5. **Fee Payment**: Transaction fees and premium features

### Deflationary Mechanics

**50% Burn Rate**: Half of all distributed rewards are permanently burned
- **Vote Rewards**: 50% burned on distribution
- **Prize Break Rewards**: 50% burned on claim
- **Trading Fees**: 50% of collected fees burned
- **Penalty Burns**: Failed votes, abandoned sessions

### Value Accrual

```
Circulating Supply â†“ (burns) + Demand â†‘ (utility) = Price Appreciation
```

---

## Vote Logic & Elo System

### Elo Rating Algorithm

Based on chess Elo with NFT-specific modifications:

```typescript
function calculateEloChange(winnerElo: number, loserElo: number, voteType: string): EloUpdate {
    const kFactor = voteType === 'super' ? 64 : 32; // 2x impact for super votes
    
    const expectedWinner = 1 / (1 + Math.pow(10, (loserElo - winnerElo) / 400));
    const expectedLoser = 1 - expectedWinner;
    
    return {
        winnerChange: Math.round(kFactor * (1 - expectedWinner)),
        loserChange: Math.round(kFactor * (0 - expectedLoser))
    };
}
```

### Vote Types

**1. Standard Vote** (1 Lick cost)
- K-factor: 32
- Base reward: 3 XP
- Elo impact: Standard

**2. Super Vote** (5 Lick cost)
- K-factor: 64 (2x impact)
- Base reward: 15 XP
- Elo impact: Double
- Streak multiplier: 2x

**3. Slider Vote** (1 Lick cost)
- Aesthetic rating: 1-10 scale
- Cumulative scoring for cold-start NFTs
- Transition to matchup votes after sufficient data

### Matchup Generation

**Intelligent Pairing Algorithm**:
1. **Elo Proximity**: Match NFTs within 200 Elo points when possible
2. **Collection Diversity**: 60% cross-collection, 40% same-collection matches
3. **Recency Weighting**: Prefer recently unseen NFTs
4. **User Preference**: Respect collection filtering choices

### Anti-Gaming Measures

- **Vote Validation**: Cryptographic session signatures
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum votes per time period
- **Pattern Detection**: Unusual voting pattern flagging
- **Economic Penalties**: Stake slashing for malicious behavior

---

## Burn Economics

### Deflationary Model

**50% Universal Burn Rate** across all reward mechanisms:

```typescript
function distributeReward(amount: number, recipient: address): void {
    const userReward = amount * 0.5;     // 50% to user
    const burnAmount = amount * 0.5;     // 50% burned forever
    
    transfer(recipient, userReward);
    burn(burnAmount);
    
    emit RewardDistributed(recipient, userReward, burnAmount);
}
```

### Burn Sources

**1. Vote Rewards** (Daily Volume: ~10,000 GUGO)
- Every vote generates GUGO rewards
- 50% immediately burned on distribution

**2. Prize Break Claims** (Daily Volume: ~5,000 GUGO)
- Random reward distributions
- 50% burned on each claim

**3. Purchase Transactions** (Daily Volume: ~2,000 GUGO)
- Licks purchases with GUGO
- 50% of transaction value burned

**4. Penalty Burns** (Daily Volume: ~500 GUGO)
- Abandoned voting sessions
- Invalid vote attempts
- Anti-gaming enforcement

### Economic Impact

**Total Daily Burns**: ~8,750 GUGO (50% of 17,500 daily rewards)

**Annual Burn Rate**: ~3.2M GUGO
- Assuming steady daily activity
- Scales with platform growth
- Accelerates during high-activity periods

### Supply Dynamics

```
Year 1: 10M â†’ 6.8M tokens (-32% supply)
Year 2: 6.8M â†’ 4.6M tokens (-32% supply)  
Year 3: 4.6M â†’ 3.1M tokens (-33% supply)
```

*Deflationary pressure increases as supply decreases*
